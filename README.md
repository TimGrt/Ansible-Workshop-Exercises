# Ansible Workshop Exercises

This repository contains all exercise descriptions for my Ansible Workshop, utilizing the Red Hat demo environment. The Workshop is inspired by the [Red Hat Training course for Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/workshops), but adds additional exercises and more descriptions for a multi-day workshop.
The exercises are build with MkDocs and published to [Github pages](https://timgrt.github.io/Ansible-Workshop-Exercises).

A *Containerfile* is provided which bundles all requirements and displays the resulting content in a webserver.

```bash
podman build -t ansible-workshop-exercise-guide .
```

Start a container from the image, the webserver is available at Port 8080:
